		<div class="col-md-12">
			<p>The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into 
a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a 
capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, 
and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.</p>
            <p>At Tameside CoderDojo we use it to code in Python and <a href="scratch.php">Scratch</a>, make music with Sonic Pi, and make Minecraft mods.</p>

				<h3>Buy A Raspberry Pi</h3>
                <p>We have some Rasperry Pis at the dodjo for you to use, but if you want to carry on the fun at home, they're not expensive to buy.</p>
				<p>You can buy a Raspberry Pi for around £25.  You need a USB keyboard, a USB mouse, HDMI cable and HDMI TV/Monitor to use it.

			<h3>Why Raspberry Pi?</h3>
			<p>It’s great for programming on, using Scratch and Python. There's a free version of
Minecraft for it too, which allows you to control the Minecraft world using programming languages
such as Python.
