			<h2>What is CoderDojo?</h2>
			<p>CoderDojo is an open source, volunteer led movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs (Dojos) for young people. Since CoderDojo is an open source movement, each CoderDojo is different and completely autonomous! CoderDojos are set up, run by and led by volunteers.</p>
			<p>At a CoderDojo, young people between 7 and 17 learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and much more. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable and awesome experience. CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one rule: “Be Cool“, bullying, lying, wasting people’s time and so on is uncool, but having fun while learning new skills and creating projects with code is very cool.</p>
