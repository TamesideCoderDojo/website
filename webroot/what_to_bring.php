			<h2>What will I need to bring?</h2>
			<p>The only thing you really <strong>need</strong> to bring is your imagination!<p>

			<p>Aside from that, a few other things will be helpful:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>A Laptop</strong> - if you have your own laptop please bring it with you (don't forget to charge it!). If you don't have one, we have other equipment you can use.</li>
				<li><strong>An Adult</strong> - if you're under 12 years old you'll need to bring an adult with you, who will need to stay for the session (who knows, they might learn a thing or two themselves).</li>
				<li><strong>Lunch money</strong> - there is a cafe in Active Medlock.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have your own Raspberry Pi feel free to bring it along - that way you can carry on the fun at home! Please remember your power supply, keyboard, SD card etc.</p>
